# The frugal parameterization

\newcommand{\cmid}{\,|\,}

A _frugal parameterization_ of $(Z,A,Y)$ consists of (at least) three separate pieces, 
corresponding to smooth and regular parameterizations of:

 - the past -- that is $P(Z,A)$;
 
 - the causal piece of interest -- $P^*(Y \mid A)$;
 
 - a _(conditional) dependence measure_ that describes the structure of $Z$-$Y$
 interactions, typically a copula or conditional odds ratio.
 
These can then be combined into unique smooth parameterization of $P(Z,A,Y)$.

## Marginal modelling

The frugal parameterization was introduced to facilitate the modelling of 
_marginal_ causal quantities.  For example, consider the graph below, and 
suppose we are interested in modelling $P(Y \cmid do(A=a))$ as a function of 
$a$.  Under the assumptions encoded in the graph this is identified by
\begin{align*}
P(Y \mid do(A=a)) = \sum_{z \in {\cal Z}} P(Z=z) \cdot P(Y \cmid Z=z, A=a).
\end{align*}
In this case the we would have $P^*(Y \mid A) = P(Y \mid do(A))$, and choose 
a dependence measure suitable for the task.
